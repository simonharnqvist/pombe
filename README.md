# Determinants of sequence evolution constraints in the protein coding genome of fission yeast
This repository contains the R scripts for the paper "Variables influencing differences in sequence conservation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe".

## Retrieve data
All data are found on doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5263523. 

## Run notebooks
Once all data are assembled, it *should* be possible to run the notebooks as they are without modification. The file structure is the following: <br>

<b> pombe </b> <br>
(all scripts and notebooks here) <br>
<b> data </b> <br>
(all data here) <br>

However, this code is not really designed to run out-of-the-box. Please get in touch with the corresponding authors if you need help reusing our code or reproducing our results.
