# Determinants of sequence evolution constraints in the protein coding genome of fission yeast
This repository contains the R scripts for the paper "Determinants of the rate of molecular evolution in fission yeast".

## Retrieve data
All data are found on doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5263523. The GO data must be processed manually, unfortunately; instructions for this are given in the manuscript.

## Run notebooks
Once all data are assembled, it *should* be possible to run the notebooks as they are without modification.
